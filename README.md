# Visualising Stocks

This project is a single-page web app developed with Dash, a Python framework, designed to visualize and forecast stock prices. It shows company details such as the logo, registered name, and description, along with stock plots based on the user's input of the stock code. Furthermore, a machine learning model predicts stock prices for a date specified by the user.
